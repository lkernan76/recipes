Kernan Family Stroganoff

1 small yellow onion
16 oz baby bella mushrooms, sliced
2 lbs ground beef
24 oz sour cream
3/4 C warm water
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
2 tsp beef bullion liquid
Kosher salt to taste

12 oz extra wide egg noodles

Cook egg noodles using package directions, making sure to add salt to water prior
to adding noodles.

Place onion and mushrooms in preheated pan, adding salt to pull liquid out.
Cover and cook on medium high for 5-6 minutes. Add ground beef with more salt
and continue cooking until ground beef is fully browned.

While beef is cooking, mix sour cream with warm water, stirring slowly until 
fully incorporated. Then add pepper and bullion and stir to incorporate.

Once ground beef is fully browned, drain fat from the mixture and then pour sour
cream mixture in, heat until sour cream is bubbly. Drain egg noodles and add to
pan with beef and sour cream. Stir to combine.

Enjoy!
